# Analysis code and data for my master thesis

The plots of my master thesis are created with the two jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) in the repository root.
The notebooks import functions from the respective `*.py` file.

Analysis data resides in the `data` folder.

Not necessary for the plots are the sequencing results of the plasmids I created. 
Those reside in `data/sequencing_results`.

# Analysis code and data for my master thesis

The plots of my master thesis are created with the two jupyter notebooks in the repository root.
The jupyter notebooks import functions from the respective python file.

Analysis data resides in the `data` folder.

Not necessary for the plots are the sequencing results of the plasmids I created. Those reside in `data/sequencing_results`.
